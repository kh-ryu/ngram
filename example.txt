 now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite  and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children  and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there  and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions  but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb  and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb  and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat  then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons   so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord  and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore  and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head  and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth  now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken  and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee  and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord  count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto  then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him  and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad  and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her  wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord  and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow  but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever  and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him  and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young  and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli  and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord  for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him  therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there  and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation  there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god  talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed  the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength  they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble  the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up  the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up  he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he hath set the world upon them  he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail  the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed  and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest  now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord  and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand  and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither  also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw  and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force  wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord  but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod  moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice  and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and they went unto their own home  and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord  now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation  and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people  nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the lords people to transgress  if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them  and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men  and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in pharaohs house   and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel   wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people   wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed  behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thine house  and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever  and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age  and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them  and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever  and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread  and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision  and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see  and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep  that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i  and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down  and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again  now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him  and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child  therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place  and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth  and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle  in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end  for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not  and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever  and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision  then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he answered here am i  and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee  and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good  and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground  and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord  and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord  and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched in aphek  and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men  and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies  so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god  and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again  and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp  and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore  woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness  be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight  and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen  and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain  and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head  and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out  and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli  now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see  and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my son   and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken  and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged israel forty years  and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon her  and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not neither did she regard it  and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband  and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken  and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod  when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon  and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again  and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him  therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day  but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof  and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god  they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither  and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts  therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people  so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there  and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven  and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months  and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place  and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you  then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords  wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land  wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed   now therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them  and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go  and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us  and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home  and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods  and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh  and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it  and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord  and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord  and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day  and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one  and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite  and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter  and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us   and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you  and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord  and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after the lord  and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines  then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and served the lord only  and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for you unto the lord  and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh  and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines  and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines  and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him  and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel  and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar  then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us  so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel  and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites  and samuel judged israel all the days of his life  and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places  and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord  and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel  now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abiah they were judges in beersheba  and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment  then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah  and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations  but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord  and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them  according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee  now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them  and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king  and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots  and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots  and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers  and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants  and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants  and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work  he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants  and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day  nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us  that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles  and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord  and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city  now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power  and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people  and the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses  and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not  and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us  and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go  then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we   and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way  beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer   then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was  and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here  and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place  as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him  and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place  now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying  to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me  and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people  then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seers house is  and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart  and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house   and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me   and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons  and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee  and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day  and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house  and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad  and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god  then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance   when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son   then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine  and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands  after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy  and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man  and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee  and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do  and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day  and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them  and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets   and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets   and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place  and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye  and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel  and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you  and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not  and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh  and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you  and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands  and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken  when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found  therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff  and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward  and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king  then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house  and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched  but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace  then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee  and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel  and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee  then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept  and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh  and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly  and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent  and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand  and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh and they were glad  therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you  and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together  and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death  and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel  then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there  and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly  and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you  and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day  behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you  and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand  and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is witness  and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt  now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers  when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place  and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them  and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee  and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe  and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king  now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you  if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god  but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers  now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes  is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king  so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel  and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king  and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart  and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain  for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people  moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way  only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you  but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king  saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel  saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent  and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear  and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal  and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven  when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits  and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling  and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him  and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering  and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him  and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash  therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering  and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever  but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee  and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men  and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash  and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual  and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness  now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears  but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock  yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads  so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found  and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash  now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father  and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men  and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lords priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone  and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh  the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah  and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few  and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart  then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them  if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them  but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us  and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves  and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel  and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him  and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow  and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling  and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one another  then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there  and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel  and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand  and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every mans sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture  moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan  likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle  so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven  and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food  and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground  and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath  but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened  then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint  then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey  how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines   and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the people were very faint  and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood  then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day  and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there  and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord  and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god  and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day  and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day  for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among all the people that answered him  then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee  therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect lot and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped  and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken  then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die  and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan  and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan that he died not  then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place  so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them  and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them  now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal  and the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle  and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel  and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto him  samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord  thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt  now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass  and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah  and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley  and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites  and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur that is over against egypt  and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword  but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly  then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying  it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night  and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal  and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord  and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear   and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed  then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on  and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel   and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed  wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord  and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites  but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal  and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams  for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king  and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice  now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord  and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel  and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent  and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou  and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent  then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god  so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord  then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past  and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal  then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul  and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel  and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons  and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord  and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee  and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably   and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice  and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him  but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart  then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this  then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this  again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these  and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither  and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he  then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah  but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him  and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee  let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well  and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me  then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him  wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep  and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul  and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer  and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight  and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him  now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim  and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines  and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them  and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span  and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass  and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders  and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him  and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me  if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us  and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together  when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid  now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul  and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah  and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul  but david went and returned from saul to feed his fathers sheep at bethlehem  and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days  and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp of thy brethren  and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge  now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines  and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battle  for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army  and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren  and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them  and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid  and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up  surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in israel  and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god   and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him  and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle  and david said what have i now done is there not a cause  and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner  and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him  and david said to saul let no mans heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine  and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth  and david said unto saul thy servant kept his fathers sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock  and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him  thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god  david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee  and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail  and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him  and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine  and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him  and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance  and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods  and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field  then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied  this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel  and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hands  and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine  and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth  so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david  therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled  and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron  and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their tents  and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent  and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell  and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is  and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand  and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite  and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul  and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers house  then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul  and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle  and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of sauls servants  and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musick  and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands  and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom  and saul eyed david from that day and forward  and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in sauls hand  and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice  and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul  therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people  and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him  wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him  but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them  and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lords battles for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him  and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my fathers family in israel that i should be son in law to the king  but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife  and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him  and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain  and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the kings son in law  and sauls servants spake those words in the ears of david and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings son in law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed   and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david  and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines  and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the kings son in law and the days were not expired  wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the kings son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife  and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that michal sauls daughter loved him  and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became davids enemy continually  then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by  and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david  but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself  and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee  and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very good  for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause   and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain  and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past  and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him  and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand  and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night  saul also sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain  so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped  and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth  and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick  and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him  and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster  and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee   so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth  and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah  and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied  and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also  then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah  and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah  and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets   and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life   and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so  and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death  then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee  and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even  if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family  if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him  therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father   and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee   then said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly   and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field  and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee  the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father  and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not  but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth  so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies  and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul  then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty  and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel  and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark  and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth  but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away  and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever  so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meat  and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by sauls side and davids place was empty  nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean  and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that davids place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day   and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem  and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he cometh not unto the kings table  then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mothers nakedness   for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die  and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done   and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david  so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame  and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him  and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him  and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee   and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master  but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter  and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city  and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded  and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city  then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee   and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place  now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present  and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women  and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel  so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away  now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul  and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required haste  and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here and david said there is none like that give it me  and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath  and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands  and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath  and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard  then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me   have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house   david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to him  and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men  and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me  and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold  and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hareth  when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him  then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds  that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day   then answered doeg the edomite which was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub  and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine  then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king  and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord  and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day   then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house   did i then begin to enquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more  and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy fathers house  and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord  and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod  and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword  and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david  and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lords priests  and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house  abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard  then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors  therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah  and davids men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines   then david enquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand  so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah  and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand  and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars  and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men  and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod  then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake  will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down  then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up  then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth  and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand  and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood  and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god  and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth  and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house  then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon   now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the kings hand  and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me  go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly  see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah  and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon  saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon  and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them  but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land  wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth  and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi  and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi  then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats  and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave  and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily  and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt  and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lords anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord  so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way  david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself  and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou mens words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt   behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lords anointed  moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it  the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee  as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee  after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea  the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand  and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept  and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil  and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not  for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day  and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand  swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house  and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the hold  and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran  and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel  now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb  and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep  and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name  and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast  and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel  ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david  and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased  and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master  shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be   so davids young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings  and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff  but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them  but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields  they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep  now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him  then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses  and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband nabal  and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them  now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good  so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall  and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground  and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid  let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send  now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal  and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord  i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days  yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling  and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel  that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid  and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me  and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand  for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall  so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person  and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light  but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone  and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died  and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife  and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife  and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord  and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife  david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of them his wives  but saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim  and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon   then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph  and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness  david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come in very deed  and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about him  then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee  so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him  then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time  and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless   david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish  the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go  so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them  then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them  and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king   and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord  this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lords anointed and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster  and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king  and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant  for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand   now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods  now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains  then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly  and david answered and said behold the kings spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it  the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed  and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation  then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david went on his way and saul returned to his place  and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand  and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath  and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife  and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him  and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee   then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day  and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months  and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt  and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish  and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites  and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines  and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever  and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men  and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever  now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land  and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa  and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled  and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets  then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor  and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee  and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die   and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing  then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel  and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul  and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth  and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself  and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do  then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy   and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david  because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day  moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines  then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night  and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me  now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way  but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed  and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof  and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night  now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel  and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish  then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here  and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day   and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these men   is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands   then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not  wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines  and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king  and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle  wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy masters servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light depart  so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel  and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire  and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way  so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives  then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep  and davids two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite  and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god  and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelechs son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david  and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all  so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed  but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor  and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink water  and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights  and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick  we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire  and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this company  and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah  and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled  and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives  and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david recovered all  and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is davids spoil  and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them  then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart  then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand  for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike  and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day  and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord  to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir  and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa  and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites  and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach  and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt  now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa  and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua sauls sons  and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archers  then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it  and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him  so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together  and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them  and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa  and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people  and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan  and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul  all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there  and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabesh and fasted seven days now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag  it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance  and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped  and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also  and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead   and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him  and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i  and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite  he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me  so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord  then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him  and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword  and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite  and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lords anointed   and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died  and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lords anointed  and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son  also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher  the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen   tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph  ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil  from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty  saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions  ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel  how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places  i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women  how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished   and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron  so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail nabals wife the carmelite  and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron  and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul  and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him  and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing  therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them  but abner the son of ner captain of sauls host took ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim  and made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel  ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed david  and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months  and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon  and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool  and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play before us and joab said let them arise  then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david  and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon  and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david  and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe  and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner  then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he answered i am  and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour but asahel would not turn aside from following of him  and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother   howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still  joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon  and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill  then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren   and joab said as god liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother  so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more  and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to mahanaim  and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen men and asahel  but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abners men so that three hundred and threescore men died  and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night and they came to hebron at break of day  now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker  and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess  and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur  and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital  and the sixth ithream by eglah davids wife these were born to david in hebron  and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house of saul  and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine   then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dogs head which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman   so do god to abner and more also except as the lord hath sworn to david even so i do to him  to translate the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba  and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him  and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee  and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face  and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines  and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish  and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim then said abner unto him go return and he returned  and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye sought for david in times past to be king over you  now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies  and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin  so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast  and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth and david sent abner away and he went in peace  and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace  when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace  then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone   thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest  and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not  and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother  and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner  let it rest on the head of joab and on all his fathers house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread  so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle  and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner and king david himself followed the bier  and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept  and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth   thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the people wept again over him  and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down  and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people  for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner  and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel   and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness  and when sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled  and sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin  and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day   and jonathan sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth  and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon  and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped  for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night  and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed  and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity  when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings  how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth   and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron  then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh  also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel  so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel  david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years  in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah  and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither  nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david  and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of davids soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house  so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward  and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him  and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house  and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels sake  and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david  and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon  ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia  and elishama and eliada and eliphalet  but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold  the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim  and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand  and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim  and there they left their images and david and his men burned them  and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim  and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees  and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines  and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer  again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand  and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims  and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart  and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark  and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals  and when they came to nachons threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it  and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god  and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day  and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me   so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite  and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household  and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness  and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings  and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod  so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet  and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart  and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord  and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts  and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed every one to his house  then david returned to bless his household and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself   and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord  and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour  therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death  and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies  that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains  and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee  and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying  go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in   whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle  in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar   now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel  and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth  moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime  and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house  and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom  he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever  i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men  but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee  and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever  according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david  then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto   and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god   and what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy servant  for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them  wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears  and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods   for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art become their god  and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast said  and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee  for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee  and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant  therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever  and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines  and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became davids servants and brought gifts  david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates  and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots  and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men  then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went  and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem  and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass  when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer  then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass  which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued  of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah  and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men  and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all they of edom became davids servants and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went  and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people  and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder  and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the scribe  and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief rulers  and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathans sake   and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba  and he said thy servant is he  and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet  and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar  then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lodebar  now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant   and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually  and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am   then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thy masters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house  thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants  then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sons  and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth  so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and was lame on both his feet  and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead  then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon  and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it  wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away  when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return  and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men  and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men  and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field  when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians  and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon  and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee  be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good  and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him  and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem  and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together  and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them  and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him  and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there  and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more  and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem  and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon  and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite  and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house  and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child  and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david  and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered  and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king  but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house  and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine house   and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing  and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow  and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house  and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah  and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die  and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were  and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also  then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war  and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king  and if so be that the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall   who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also  so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for  and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate  and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also  then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him  and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband  and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord  and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor  the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter  and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him  and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity  and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul  and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things  wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon  now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife  thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun  for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun  and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die  howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die  and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick  david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth  and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them  and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead   but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead  then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat  then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread  and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live   but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me  and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him  and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord  and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city  and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters  now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name  and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it  and he took their kings crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance  and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem  and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her  and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her  but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtil man  and he said unto him why art thou being the kings son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absaloms sister  and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand  so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand  then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnons house and dress him meat  so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes  and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him  and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother  and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister  and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly  and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee  howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her  then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone  and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her  then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her  and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her  and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying  and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother absaloms house  but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth  and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar  and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons  and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant  and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him  then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee  but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him  now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant  and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled  and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them left  then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent  and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar  now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is dead  but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him  and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons come as thy servant said so it is  and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore  but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourned for his son every day  so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years  and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead  now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward absalom  and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead  and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth  and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king  and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead  and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him  and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth  and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will give charge concerning thee  and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltless  and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more  then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth  then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he said say on  and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished  for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from him  now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid  for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god  then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee  then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak  and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all this  and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid  to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth  and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again  and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant  so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem  and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the kings face  but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him  and when he polled his head for it was at every years end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight  and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance  so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the kings face  therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come  therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absaloms servants set the field on fire  then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire   and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me  so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom  and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him  and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel  and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee  absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice   and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him  and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel  and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron  for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i will serve the lord  and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron  but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron  and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing  and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom  and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom  and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword  and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint  and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house  and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off  and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king  then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile  whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee  and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be  and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him  and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness  and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city  and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation  but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him  the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar  see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me  zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there  and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up  and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness  and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head  unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me  but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel  and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests  therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests  behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear  so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem  and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine  and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink  and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father  then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king  and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came  and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left  and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial  the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man  then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head  and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah  so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so   and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him  it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day  and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust  and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there  and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him  and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king  and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend   and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide  and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so will i be in thy presence  then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do  and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong  so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel  and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom  moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night  and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only  and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace  and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel  then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith  and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou  and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time  for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people  behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom  and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men  therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person  so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one  moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there  and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom  then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled  now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him  now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david  nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down  and the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known  and when absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem  and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you  then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan  and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father  then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him  and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a mans son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs mother  so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead  and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim  brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse  and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness  and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them  and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also  but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city  and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands  and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom  so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim  where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men  for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured  and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away  and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak  and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle  and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom  otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me  then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak  and ten young men that bare joabs armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him  and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people  and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent  now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absaloms place  then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies  and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the kings son is dead  then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran  then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready   but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi  and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone  and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near  and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings  and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings  and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king  and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was  and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still  and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee  and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is  and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son   and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom  and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son  and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle  but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son   and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines  in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well  now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now  then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent  and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom  and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back   and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house  ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king   and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab  and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants  so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan  and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david  and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king  and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan  and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart  for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king  but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lords anointed   and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel   therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him  and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace  and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth   and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame  and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes  for all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king   and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land  and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house  and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan  now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man  and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem  and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem   i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king   thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward   let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee  and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee  and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place  then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel  and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all davids men with him over jordan   and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings cost or hath he given us any gift   and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel  and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel  so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem  and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood  then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present  so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him  and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us  and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri  when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them and joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out  and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him  but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri  and one of joabs men stood by him and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him go after joab  and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still  when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri  and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him  and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down  then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee  and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab  and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear  then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter  i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord   and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy  the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall  then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king  now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites  and adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder  and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the priests  and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david  then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites  and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah  wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you  and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord   and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you  and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel  let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them  but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul  but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite  and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest  and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night  and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done  and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa  and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged  and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land  moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint  and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david  but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel  and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which was of the sons of the giant  and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam  and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant  and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew him  these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants  and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul  and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer  the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence  i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies  when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid  the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me  in my distress i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears  then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth  there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it  he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet  and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind  and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skies  through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled  the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice  and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them  and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils  he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters  he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me  they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay  he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me  the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me  for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god  for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them  i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquity  therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight  with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright  with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury  and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down  for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my darkness  for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall  as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him  for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god  god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect  he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places  he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms  thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great  thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip  i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until i had consumed them  and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are fallen under my feet  for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me  thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me  they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not  then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad  thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not shall serve me  strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto me  strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close places  the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation  it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people under me  and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man  therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name  he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore  now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said  the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue  the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god  and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain  although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow  but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away because they cannot be taken with hands  but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place  these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time  and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away  he arose and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil  and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines  but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory  and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim  and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem  and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate   and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord  and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men  and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three  was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three  and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow  and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear  these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among three mighty men  he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard  asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem  shammah the harodite elika the harodite  helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite  abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite  zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite  heleb the son of baanah a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children of benjamin  benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash  abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite  eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan  shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite  eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite  hezrai the carmelite paarai the arbite  igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite  zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah  ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite  uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all  and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah  for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the people  and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing   notwithstanding the kings word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel  and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer  then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon  and came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even to beersheba  so when they had gone through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days  and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men  and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly  for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad davids seer saying  go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee  so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me  and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man  so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men  and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite  and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my fathers house  and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite  and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded  and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground  and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant  and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people  and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood  all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee  and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver  and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat  wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat  so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king  and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not  then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him  and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom  and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him  but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah  and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants  but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not  wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not   now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon  go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign   behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words  and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king  and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou   and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne  and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not  and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called  and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him  otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders  and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in  and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground  and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne   for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah  but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called  is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him   then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king  and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress  even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day  then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever  and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king  the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon  and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon  then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah  and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too  as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david  so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to gihon  and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon  and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them  and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar   and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings  and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king  and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule  and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard  and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom  and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed  and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it  and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way  and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar  and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword  and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die  so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house  now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying  i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man  and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself  that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel  moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet  do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace  but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother  and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword  now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood  so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david  and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem  then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly  and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably  he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on  and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the lord  and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on  and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife  and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king  bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right hand  then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay  and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife  and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah  then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life  now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day  and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died  and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted  so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh  then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar  and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him  and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me  and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father  and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah  their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord  so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness  and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar  and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither  for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head  and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days  and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath  and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath  and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again  and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good  why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with   the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head  and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever  so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon  and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about  only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days  and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places  and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar  in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee  and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day  and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in  and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude  give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people   and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing  and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment  behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee  and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days  and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days  and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants  then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him  and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house  and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house  and this womans child died in the night because she overlaid it  and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom  and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear  and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king  then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living  and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king  and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other  then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it  then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof  and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment  so king solomon was king over all israel  and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest  elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder  and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were the priests  and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and the kings friend  and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute  and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision  and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim  the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbethhanan  the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained sochoh and all the land of hepher  the son of abinadab in all the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife  baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam  the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars  ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim  ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife  baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth  jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar  shimei the son of elah in benjamin  geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the land  judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry  and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life  and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal  ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl  for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him  and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon  and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen  and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomons table every man in his month they lacked nothing  barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his charge  and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore  and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt  for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about  and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five  and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes  and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom  and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david  and solomon sent to hiram saying  thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet  but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent  and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name  now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians  and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people  and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir  my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household  so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire  and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year  and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together  and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men  and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy  and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains  beside the chief of solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work  and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house  and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house  and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord  and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits  and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house  and for the house he made windows of narrow lights  and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about  the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house  and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building  the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third  so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar  and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar  and the word of the lord came to solomon saying  concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father  and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel  so solomon built the house and finished it  and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir  and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place  and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long  and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen  and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord  and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar  so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold  and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold  and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits high  and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits  and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one size  the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub  and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house  and he overlaid the cherubims with gold  and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and without  and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within and without  and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall  the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees  so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall  and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding  and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work  and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams  in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif  and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building it  but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house  he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars  and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a row  and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks  and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranks  and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them  then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other  and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaohs daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch  all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great court  and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits  and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars  and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the lord and for the porch of the house  and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre  he was a widows son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work  for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about  and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits  and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter  and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter  and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubits  and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter  and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz  and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished  and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about  and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was cast  it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward  and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths  and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it  and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges  and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work  and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition  and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round  and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit  and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten  and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself  and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same  for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about  after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one size  then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver  and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south  and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord  the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars  and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases  and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea  and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass  in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan  and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out  and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread was  and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold  and the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple  so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord  then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion  and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month  and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark  and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the levites bring up  and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude  and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims  for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above  and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day  there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt  and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord  then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness  i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever  and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood  and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying  since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel  and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel  and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart  nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name  and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel  and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt  and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven  and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart  who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day  therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me  and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father  but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded   yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day  that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place  and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive  if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house  then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness  when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house  then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers  when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them  then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance  if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be  what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house  then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men  that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers  moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy names sake  for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house  hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy name  if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy name  then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause  if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near  yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness  and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name  then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause  and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them  for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron  that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee  for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god  and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven  and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying  blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant  the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us  that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers  and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel at all times as the matter shall require  that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else  let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day  and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before the lord  and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord  the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings  and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days  on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel his people  and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desire which he was pleased to do  that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon  and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually  and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments  then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel  but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them  then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people  and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house   and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil  and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house  now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee  and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not  and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day  and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold  and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer  for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomons wife  and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether  and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land  and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion  and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel  their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day  but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen  these were the chief of the officers that were over solomons work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work  but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo  and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house  and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom  and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon  and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon  and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions  and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart  and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not  and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom and the house that he had built  and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her  and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom  howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard  happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom  blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice  and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon  and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones  and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day  and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants  now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold  beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country  and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target  and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon  moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold  the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays  and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom  and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon  for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks  so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom  and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart  and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year  and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at jerusalem  and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance  and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price  and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means  but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites  of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love  and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart  for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father  for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites  and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father  then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon  and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods  and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice  and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded  wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant  notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son  howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake which i have chosen  and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the kings seed in edom  for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom  for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom  that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child  and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land  and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen  and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs household among the sons of pharaoh  and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country  then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise  and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah  and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus  and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria  and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomons servant whose mothers name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king  and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father  and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph  and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field  and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces  and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee  but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel  because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father  howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes  but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes  and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there  and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel  and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee  and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever  solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon  and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon  and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years  and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead  and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king  and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee  and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed  and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that i may answer this people   and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever  but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him  and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter   and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins  and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions  so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day  and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old mens counsel that they gave him  and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions  wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat  so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents  but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them  then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem  so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day  and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only  and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon  but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying  speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people saying  thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord  then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel  and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david  if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah  whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt  and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan  and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan  and he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi  and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made  so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense  and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense  and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burnt upon thee  and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out  and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him  the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord  and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the kings hand was restored him again and became as it was before  and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward  and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place  for so was it charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest  so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel  now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father  and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah  and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon  and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am  then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread  and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place  for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest  he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him  so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water  and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back  and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee  but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers  and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back  and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase  and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt  and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spake unto him  and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled him  and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass  and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him  and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother   and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones  for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass  after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places  and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth  at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick  and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me that i should be king over this people  and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child  and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age  and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman  and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings  go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel  and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes  but hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back  therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone  him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it  arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die  and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam  moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now  for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger  and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin  and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child died  and they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet  and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead  and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess  and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had done  for they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree  and there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel  and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made  and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the kings house  and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamber  now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah  and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days  and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead  now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah  three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom  and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as the heart of david his father  nevertheless for davids sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem  because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite  and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life  now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam  and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead  and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah  and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom  and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father  and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made  and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook kidron  but the high places were not removed nevertheless asas heart was perfect with the lord all his days  and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels  and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days  and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah  then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying  there is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me  so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of naphtali  and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah  then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah  the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet  and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead  and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years  and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin  and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon  even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead  and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite  because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger  now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days  in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years  and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin  then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying  forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins  behold i will take away the posterity of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat  him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat  now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead  and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he killed him  in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years  and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah  and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead  and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends  thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet  for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities  now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines  and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp  and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah  and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died  for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin  now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri  but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned  in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah  and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria  but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him  for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities  now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead  and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years  and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him  and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him  and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria  and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him  in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun  and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word  and the word of the lord came unto him saying  get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan  and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there  so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan  and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook  and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land  and the word of the lord came unto him saying  arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee  so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink  and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand  and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die  and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son  for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth  and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days  and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah  and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him  and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son   and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed  and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son   and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this childs soul come into him again  and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived  and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth  and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth  and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth  and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria  and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly  for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water   and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts  so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself  and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah   and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here  and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me   as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not  and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here  and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth  was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lords prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water   and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me  and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day  so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah  and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel   and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim  now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table  so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel  and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word  then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men  let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under  and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken  and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under  and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made  and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked  and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them  and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded  and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down  and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name  and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed  and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood  and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time  and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water  and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word  hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again  then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench  and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god  and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there  and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain  so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees  and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times  and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not  and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel  and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel  and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword  then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time  and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there  but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers  and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat  and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again  and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee  and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god  and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah   and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away  and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake  and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice  and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah   and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away  and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king over syria  and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room  and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay  yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him  so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him  and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee  and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him  and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it  and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad  thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine  and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have  and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children  yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away  then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not  and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent  wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again  and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me  and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off  and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city  and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord  and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou  then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand  and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him  and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria  and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive  so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them  and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen  and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter  and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee  and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they  and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms  and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so  and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel  and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country  and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord  and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day  but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber  and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life  so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother  now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot  and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away  and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him  then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him  then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him  so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face  and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver  and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it  and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets  and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people  and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria  and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria  and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money  and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee  and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread  but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread   and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard  and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite  so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth  and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people  and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die  and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them  they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people  and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died  then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead  and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead  and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it  and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying  arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it  and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine  and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord  behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel  and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin  and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel  him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat  but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up  and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel  and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly  and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying  seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house  and they continued three years without war between syria and israel  and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel  and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria   and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses  and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day  then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king  and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him   and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so  then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah  and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them  and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them  and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the kings hand  and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good  and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak  so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king  and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord   and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil   and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left  and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner  and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him  and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and do so  now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee  but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee   and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself  and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son  and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace  and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you  so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle  but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him  and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded  and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot  and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country  so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria  and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the lord which he spake  now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel  so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead  and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel  jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi  and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places  and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel  now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   and the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out of the land  there was then no king in edom a deputy was king  jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber  then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not  and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead  ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two years over israel  and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin  for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done
