was
in

me
a
great
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
saying
i
am

first
and
the
last
and

i
turned
to

the
voice
that
spake
with
me
and
being
turned
i
saw
seven
golden
candlesticks
and
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
candlesticks
one
like
unto
the
son
of
man
clothed
with
a
garment
down
to
the
foot
and
girt
about
the
paps
with
a
golden
girdle
his
head
and
his
hairs
were
white
like
wool
as
white
as
snow
and
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
his
feet
like
unto
fine
brass
as
if
they
burned
in
a
furnace
and
his
voice
as
the
sound
of
many
waters
and
he
had
in
his
right
hand
seven
stars
and
out
of
his
mouth
went
a
sharp
twoedged
sword
and
his
countenance
was
as
the
sun
shineth
in
his
strength
and
when
i
saw
him
i
fell
at
his
feet
as
dead
and
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
me
saying
unto
me
fear
not
i
am
the
first
and
the
last
i
am
he
that
liveth
and
was
dead
and

they
are
apostles
and

not
and

found
them
liars
and
hast
borne
and
hast
patience
and
for
my
names
sake
hast
laboured
and

not
fainted
nevertheless
i
have
somewhat
against
thee
because

first
love

therefore
from
whence
thou
art
fallen
and
repent
and

works

remove
thy
candlestick
out
of
his
place
except
thou
repent
but
this
thou
hast
that
thou
hatest
the
deeds
of
the
nicolaitanes
which
i
also
hate
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
to
him
that
overcometh
will

poverty
but
thou
art
rich
and
i
know
the
blasphemy
of
them
which
say
they
are
jews
and
are
not
but
are
the
synagogue
of
satan
fear
none
of
those
things
which
thou
shalt
suffer
behold
the
devil
shall
cast
some
of
you
into
prison
that
ye
may
be
tried
and
ye
shall
have
tribulation
ten
days
be
thou
faithful
unto
death
and
i
will
give
thee
a
crown
of
life
he
that
hath
an
ear
let

hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches

things
saith
he
which
hath
the
sharp
sword
with
two
edges
i
know
thy
works
and
where
thou
dwellest
even
where
satans
seat
is
and
thou
holdest
fast
my
name
and
hast
not
denied
my
faith
even
in
those
days
wherein
antipas
was
my
faithful
martyr
who
was
slain
among
you
where
satan
dwelleth
but
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
hast
there
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
balaam
who
taught
balac
to
cast
a
stumblingblock
before
the
children
of
israel
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
and
to
commit
fornication
so
hast
thou
also
them
that
hold
the
doctrine
of
the
nicolaitanes
which
thing
i
hate
repent
or
else
i
will
come
unto
thee
quickly
and
will
fight
against
them
with
the
sword
of
my
mouth
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
give
to
eat
of
the
hidden
manna
and
will
give
him
a
white
stone
and
in
the
stone
a
new
name
written
which
no
man
knoweth
saving
he
that
receiveth
it
and
unto
the
angel
of
the
church
in
thyatira
write
these
things
saith
the
son
of
god
who
hath
his
eyes
like
unto
a
flame
of
fire
and
his
feet
are
like
fine
brass
i
know
thy
works
and
charity
and
service
and
faith
and
thy
patience
and
thy
works
and
the
last
to
be
more
than
the
first
notwithstanding
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
sufferest
that
woman
jezebel
which
calleth
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
to
seduce
my
servants
to
commit
fornication
and
to
eat
things
sacrificed
unto
idols
and
i
gave
her
space
to
repent
of
her
fornication
and
she
repented
not
behold
i
will
cast
her
into
a
bed
and
them
that
commit
adultery
with
her
into
great
tribulation
except
they
repent
of
their
deeds
and
i
will
kill
her
children
with
death
and
all
the
churches
shall
know
that
i
am
he
which
searcheth
the
reins
and
hearts
and
i
will
give
unto
every
one
of
you
according
to
your
works
but
unto
you
i
say
and
unto
the
rest
in
thyatira
as
many
as
have
not
this
doctrine
and
which
have
not
known
the
depths
of
satan
as
they
speak
i
will
put
upon
you
none
other
burden
but
that
which
ye
have
already
hold
fast
till
i
come
and
he
that
overcometh
and
keepeth
my
works
unto
the
end
to
him
will
i
give
power
over
the
nations
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
as
the
vessels
of
a
potter
shall
they
be
broken
to
shivers
even
as
i
received
of
my
father
and
i
will
give
him
the
morning

not
found
thy
works
perfect

therefore
how
thou
hast
received
and
heard
and
hold
fast
and
repent
if
therefore
thou
shalt
not
watch
i
will
come
on
thee
as
a
thief
and
thou
shalt
not
know
what
hour
i
will
come
upon
thee
thou
hast
a
few
names
even
in
sardis
which
have
not
defiled
their
garments
and
they
shall
walk
with
me
in
white
for
they
are
worthy

that
overcometh

same
shall
be
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
i
will
not
blot
out

have
set
before
thee
an
open
door
and
no
man

shut
it
for

hast
a
little
strength
and

kept
my
word

name

and

with

and

with
me
to
him
that

i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also

and

set
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
he
that
hath
an
ear
let
him
hear
what
the
spirit
saith
unto
the
churches
after
this
i
looked
and
behold
a
door
was
opened
in
heaven
and
the
first
voice
which
i
heard
was
as
it
were
of
a
trumpet
talking
with
me
which
said
come
up
hither
and
i
will
shew
thee
things
which
must
be
hereafter
and
immediately
i
was
in
the
spirit
and
behold
a
throne
was
set
in
heaven
and
one
sat
on
the
throne
and
he
that
sat
was
to
look
upon
like
a
jasper
and
a
sardine
stone
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
and
twenty
seats
and
upon
the
seats
i
saw
four
and
twenty
elders
sitting
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
they
had
on
their
heads
crowns
of
gold
and
out
of
the
throne
proceeded
lightnings
and
thunderings
and
voices
and
there
were
seven
lamps
of
fire
burning
before
the
throne
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
and
before
the
throne
there
was
a
sea
of
glass
like
unto
crystal
and
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
round
about
the
throne
were
four
beasts
full
of
eyes
before
and
behind
and
the
first
beast
was
like
a
lion
and
the
second
beast
like
a
calf
and
the
third
beast
had
a
face
as
a
man
and
the
fourth
beast
was
like
a
flying
eagle
and
the
four
beasts
had
each
of
them
six
wings
about
him
and
they
were
full
of
eyes
within
and
they
rest
not
day
and
night
saying
holy
holy
holy
lord
god
almighty
which
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
and
when
those
beasts
give
glory
and
honour
and
thanks
to
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fall
down
before
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
and
worship
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
cast
their
crowns
before
the
throne
saying
thou
art
worthy
o
lord
to
receive
glory
and
honour
and
power
for
thou
hast
created
all
things
and
for
thy
pleasure
they
are
and
were
created
and
i
saw
in
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
on
the
throne
a
book
written
within
and
on
the
backside
sealed
with
seven
seals
and
i
saw
a
strong
angel
proclaiming
with
a
loud
voice
who
is
worthy
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seals
thereof

and
no
man
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
neither
under
the
earth
was
able
to
open
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
and
i
wept
much
because
no
man
was
found
worthy
to
open
and
to
read
the
book
neither
to
look
thereon
and
one
of
the
elders
saith
unto
me
weep
not
behold
the
lion
of
the
tribe
of
juda
the
root
of
david
hath
prevailed
to
open
the
book
and
to
loose
the
seven
seals
thereof
and
i
beheld
and
lo
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
and
of
the
four
beasts
and
in
the
midst
of
the
elders
stood
a
lamb
as
it
had
been
slain
having
seven
horns
and
seven
eyes
which
are
the
seven
spirits
of
god
sent
forth
into
all
the
earth
and
he
came
and
took
the
book
out
of
the
right
hand
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
throne
and
when
he
had
taken
the
book
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
every
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odours
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints
and
they
sung
a
new
song
saying
thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
book
and
to
open
the
seals
thereof
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
hast
made
us
unto
our
god
kings
and
priests
and
we
shall
reign
on

earth
and
i

and
i
heard
the
voice
of
many
angels
round
about
the
throne
and
the
beasts
and
the
elders
and
the
number
of
them
was
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
saying
with
a
loud
voice

and
wisdom
and
strength
and

and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
beasts
said
amen
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
and
worshipped
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
i
saw
when
the
lamb
opened
one
of
the
seals
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
noise
of
thunder
one
of
the
four
beasts
saying
come
and
see
and
i
saw
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
bow
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
him
and
he
went
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
and
when
he
had
opened
the
second
seal
i
heard
the
second
beast
say
come
and
see
and
there
went
out
another
horse
that
was
red
and
power
was
given
to
him
that
sat
thereon
to
take
peace
from
the
earth
and
that
they
should
kill
one
another
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
great
sword
and
when
he
had
opened
the
third
seal
i
heard
the
third
beast
say
come
and
see
and
i
beheld
and
lo
a
black
horse
and
he
that
sat
on
him
had
a
pair
of
balances
in
his
hand
and
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
four
beasts
say
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
wine
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fourth
seal
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
fourth
beast
say
come
and
see
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
pale
horse
and
his
name
that
sat
on
him
was
death
and
hell
followed
with
him
and
power
was
given
unto
them
over
the
fourth
part
of
the
earth
to
kill
with
sword
and
with
hunger
and
with
death
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
earth
and
when
he
had
opened
the
fifth
seal
i
saw
under
the
altar
the
souls
of
them
that
were
slain
for
the
word
of
god
and
for
the
testimony
which
they
held
and
they
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
how
long
o
lord
holy
and
true
dost
thou
not
judge
and
avenge
our
blood
on
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth

and
white
robes
were
given
unto
every
one
of
them
and
it
was
said
unto
them
that
they
should
rest
yet
for
a
little
season
until
their
fellowservants
also
and
their
brethren
that
should
be
killed
as
they
were
should
be
fulfilled
and
i
beheld
when
he
had
opened
the
sixth
seal
and
lo
there
was
a
great
earthquake
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
of
hair
and
the
moon
became
as
blood
and
the
stars
of
heaven
fell
unto
the
earth
even
as
a
fig
tree
casteth
her
untimely
figs
when
she
is
shaken
of
a
mighty
wind
and
the
heaven
departed
as
a
scroll
when
it
is
rolled
together
and
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
places
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
the
great
men
and
the
rich
men
and
the
chief
captains
and
the
mighty
men
and
every
bondman
and
every
free
man
hid
themselves
in
the
dens
and
in
the
rocks
of
the
mountains
and
said
to
the
mountains
and
rocks
fall
on
us
and
hide
us
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
and
from
the
wrath
of
the
lamb
for
the
great
day
of
his
wrath
is
come
and
who
shall
be
able
to
stand

and
after
these
things
i
saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
holding
the
four
winds
of
the
earth
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
on
the
earth
nor
on
the
sea
nor
on
any
tree
and
i
saw
another
angel
ascending
from
the
east
having
the
seal
of
the
living
god
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
to
whom
it
was
given
to
hurt
the
earth
and
the
sea
saying
hurt
not
the
earth
neither
the
sea
nor
the
trees
till
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
god
in
their
foreheads
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
which
were
sealed
and
there
were
sealed
an
hundred

after
this

beheld
and
lo
a
great
multitude
which
no
man
could
number
of
all
nations
and
kindreds
and
people
and
tongues
stood
before
the
throne
and
before
the
lamb
clothed
with
white
robes
and
palms
in
their
hands
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
salvation
to
our
god
which
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
and
all
the
angels
stood
round
about
the
throne
and
about
the
elders
and
the
four
beasts
and
fell
before
the
throne
on
their
faces
and
worshipped
god
saying
amen

and
glory
and
wisdom
and
thanksgiving
and
honour
and
power
and
might
be
unto
our
god
for
ever
and
ever
amen
and
one
of
the
elders
answered
saying
unto
me
what
are
these
which
are
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
whence
came
they

and
i
said
unto
him
sir
thou
knowest
and
he
said
to
me
these
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
therefore
are
they
before
the
throne
of
god
and
serve
him
day
and
night
in
his
temple
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
they
shall
hunger
no
more
neither
thirst
any
more
neither
shall
the
sun
light
on
them
nor
any
heat
for
the
lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
when
he
had
opened
the
seventh
seal
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
and
i
saw
the
seven
angels
which
stood
before
god
and
to
them
were
given
seven
trumpets
and
another
angel
came
and
stood
at
the
altar
having
a
golden
censer
and
there
was
given
unto
him
much
incense
that
he
should
offer
it
with
the
prayers
of
all
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
which
was
before
the
throne
and
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
came
with
the
prayers
of
the
saints
ascended
up
before
god
out
of
the
angels
hand
and
the
angel
took
the
censer
and
filled
it
with
fire
of
the
altar
and
cast
it
into
the
earth
and
there
were
voices
and
thunderings
and
lightnings
and
an
earthquake
and
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
to
sound
the
first
angel
sounded
and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth
and
the
third
part
of
trees
was
burnt
up
and
all
green
grass
was
burnt
up
and
the
second
angel
sounded
and
as
it
were
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
the
third
part
of
the
sea
became
blood
and
the
third
part
of
the
creatures
which
were
in
the
sea
and
had
life
died
and
the
third
part
of
the
ships
were
destroyed
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven
burning
as
it
were
a
lamp
and
it
fell
upon
the
third
part
of
the
rivers
and
upon
the
fountains
of
waters
and
the
name
of
the
star
is
called
wormwood
and
the
third
part
of
the
waters
became
wormwood
and
many
men
died
of
the
waters
because
they
were
made
bitter
and
the
fourth
angel
sounded
and
the
third
part
of
the
sun
was
smitten
and
the
third
part
of
the
moon
and
the
third
part
of
the
stars
so
as
the
third
part
of
them
was
darkened
and
the
day
shone
not
for
a
third
part
of
it
and
the
night
likewise
and
i
beheld
and
heard
an
angel
flying
through
the
midst
of
heaven
saying
with
a
loud
voice
woe
woe
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet
of
the
three
angels
which
are
yet
to
sound

and
the
fifth
angel
sounded
and
i
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
and
to
him
was
given
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
he
opened
the
bottomless
pit
and
there
arose
a
smoke
out
of
the
pit
as
the
smoke
of
a
great
furnace
and
the
sun
and
the
air
were
darkened
by
reason
of
the
smoke
of
the
pit
and
there
came
out
of
the
smoke
locusts
upon
the
earth
and
unto
them
was
given
power
as
the
scorpions
of
the
earth
have
power
and
it
was
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
hurt
the
grass
of
the
earth
neither
any
green
thing
neither
any
tree
but
only
those
men
which
have
not
the
seal
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
to
them
it
was
given
that
they
should
not
kill
them
but
that
they
should
be
tormented
five
months
and
their
torment
was
as
the
torment
of
a
scorpion
when
he
striketh
a
man
and
in
those
days
shall
men
seek
death
and
shall
not
find
it
and
shall
desire
to
die
and
death
shall
flee
from
them
and
the
shapes
of
the
locusts
were
like
unto
horses
prepared
unto
battle
and
on
their
heads
were
as
it
were
crowns
like
gold
and
their
faces
were
as
the
faces
of
men
and
they
had
hair
as
the
hair
of
women
and
their
teeth
were
as
the
teeth
of
lions
and
they
had
breastplates
as
it
were
breastplates
of
iron
and
the
sound
of
their
wings
was
as
the
sound
of
chariots
of
many
horses
running
to
battle
and
they
had
tails
like
unto
scorpions
and
there
were
stings
in
their
tails
and
their
power
was
to
hurt
men
five
months
and
they
had
a
king
over
them
which
is
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
pit
whose
name
in
the
hebrew
tongue
is
abaddon
but
in
the
greek
tongue
hath
his
name
apollyon
one
woe
is
past
and
behold
there
come
two
woes
more
hereafter
and
the
sixth
angel
sounded
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
four
horns
of
the
golden
altar
which
is
before
god
saying
to
the
sixth
angel
which
had
the
trumpet
loose
the
four
angels
which
are
bound
in
the
great
river
euphrates
and
the
four
angels
were
loosed
which
were
prepared
for
an
hour
and
a
day
and
a
month
and
a
year
for
to
slay
the
third
part
of
men
and
the
number
of
the
army
of
the
horsemen
were
two
hundred
thousand
thousand
and
i
heard
the
number
of
them
and
thus
i
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
them
that
sat
on
them
having
breastplates
of
fire
and
of
jacinth
and
brimstone
and
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
as
the
heads
of
lions
and
out
of
their
mouths
issued
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone
by
these
three
was
the
third
part
of
men
killed
by
the
fire
and
by
the
smoke
and
by
the
brimstone
which
issued
out
of
their
mouths
for
their
power
is
in
their
mouth
and
in
their
tails
for
their
tails
were
like
unto
serpents
and
had
heads
and
with
them
they
do
hurt
and
the
rest
of
the
men
which
were
not
killed
by
these
plagues
yet
repented
not
of
the
works
of
their
hands
that
they
should
not
worship
devils
and
idols
of
gold
and
silver
and
brass
and
stone
and
of
wood
which
neither
can
see
nor
hear
nor
walk
neither
repented
they
of
their
murders
nor
of
their
sorceries
nor
of
their
fornication
nor
of
their
thefts
and
i
saw
another
mighty
angel
come
down
from
heaven
clothed
with
a
cloud
and
a
rainbow
was
upon
his
head
and
his
face
was
as
it
were
the
sun
and
his
feet
as
pillars
of
fire
and
he
had
in
his
hand
a
little
book
open
and
he
set
his
right
foot
upon
the
sea
and
his
left
foot
on
the
earth
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
as
when
a
lion
roareth
and
when
he
had
cried
seven
thunders
uttered
their
voices
and
when
the
seven
thunders
had
uttered
their
voices
i
was
about
to
write
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
seal
up
those
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered
and
write
them
not
and
the
angel
which
i
saw
stand
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
and
sware
by
him
that
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
who
created
heaven
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
earth
and
the
things
that
therein
are
and
the
sea
and
the
things
which
are
therein
that
there
should
be
time
no
longer
but
in
the
days
of
the
voice
of
the
seventh
angel
when
he
shall
begin
to
sound
the
mystery
of
god
should
be
finished
as
he
hath
declared
to
his
servants
the
prophets
and
the
voice
which
i
heard
from
heaven
spake
unto
me
again
and
said
go
and
take
the
little
book
which
is
open
in
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
standeth
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
earth
and
i
went
unto
the
angel
and
said
unto
him
give
me
the
little
book
and
he
said
unto
me
take
it
and
eat
it
up
and
it
shall
make
thy
belly
bitter
but
it
shall
be
in
thy
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
i
took
the
little
book
out
of
the
angels
hand
and
ate
it
up
and
it
was
in
my
mouth
sweet
as
honey
and
as
soon
as
i
had
eaten
it
my
belly
was
bitter
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
must
prophesy
again
before
many
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
and
there
was
given
me
a
reed
like
unto
a
rod
and
the
angel
stood
saying
rise
and
measure
the
temple
of
god
and
the
altar
and
them
that
worship
therein
but
the
court
which
is
without
the
temple
leave
out
and
measure
it
not
for
it
is
given
unto
the
gentiles
and
the
holy
city
shall
they
tread
under
foot
forty
and
two
months
and
i
will
give
power
unto
my
two
witnesses
and
they
shall
prophesy
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
clothed
in
sackcloth
these
are
the
two
olive
trees
and
the
two
candlesticks
standing
before
the
god
of
the
earth
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
fire
proceedeth
out
of
their
mouth
and
devoureth
their
enemies
and
if
any
man
will
hurt
them
he
must
in
this
manner
be
killed
these
have
power
to
shut
heaven
that
it
rain
not
in
the
days
of
their
prophecy
and
have
power
over
waters
to
turn
them
to
blood
and
to
smite
the
earth
with
all
plagues
as
often
as
they
will
and
when
they
shall
have
finished
their
testimony
the
beast
that
ascendeth
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
shall
make
war
against
them
and
shall
overcome
them
and
kill
them
and
their
dead
bodies
shall
lie
in
the
street
of
the
great
city
which
spiritually
is
called
sodom
and
egypt
where
also
our
lord
was
crucified
and
they
of
the
people
and
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
shall
see
their
dead
bodies
three
days
and
an
half
and
shall
not
suffer
their
dead
bodies
to
be
put
in
graves
and
they
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
rejoice
over
them
and
make
merry
and
shall
send
gifts
one
to
another
because
these
two
prophets
tormented
them
that
dwelt
on
the
earth
and
after
three
days
and
an
half
the
spirit
of
life
from
god
entered
into
them
and
they
stood
upon
their
feet
and
great
fear
fell
upon
them
which
saw
them
and
they
heard
a
great
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
them
come
up
hither
and
they
ascended
up
to
heaven
in
a
cloud
and
their
enemies
beheld
them
and
the
same
hour
was
there
a
great
earthquake
and
the
tenth
part
of
the
city
fell
and
in
the
earthquake
were
slain
of
men
seven
thousand
and
the
remnant
were
affrighted
and
gave
glory
to
the
god
of
heaven
the
second
woe
is
past
and
behold
the
third
woe
cometh
quickly
and
the
seventh
angel
sounded
and
there
were
great
voices
in
heaven
saying
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
and
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
which
sat
before
god
on
their
seats
fell
upon
their
faces
and
worshipped
god
saying
we
give
thee
thanks
o
lord
god
almighty
which
art
and
wast
and
art
to
come
because
thou
hast
taken
to
thee
thy
great
power
and
hast
reigned
and
the
nations
were
angry
and
thy
wrath
is
come
and
the
time
of
the
dead
that
they
should
be
judged
and
that
thou
shouldest
give
reward
unto
thy
servants
the
prophets
and
to
the
saints
and
them
that
fear
thy
name
small
and
great
and
shouldest
destroy
them
which
destroy
the
earth
and
the
temple
of
god
was
opened
in
heaven
and
there
was
seen
in
his
temple
the
ark
of
his
testament
and
there
were
lightnings
and
voices
and
thunderings
and
an
earthquake
and
great
hail
and
there
appeared
a
great
wonder
in
heaven
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
and
she
being
with
child
cried
travailing
in
birth
and
pained
to
be
delivered
and
there
appeared
another
wonder
in
heaven
and
behold
a
great
red
dragon
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
seven
crowns
upon
his
heads
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
which
was
ready
to
be
delivered
for
to
devour
her
child
as
soon
as
it
was
born
and
she
brought
forth
a
man
child
who
was
to
rule
all
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
her
child
was
caught
up
unto
god
and
to
his
throne
and
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness
where
she
hath
a
place
prepared
of
god
that
they
should
feed
her
there
a
thousand
two
hundred
and
threescore
days
and
there
was
war
in
heaven
michael
and
his
angels
fought
against
the
dragon
and
the
dragon
fought
and
his
angels
and
prevailed
not
neither
was
their
place
found
any
more
in
heaven
and
the
great
dragon
was
cast
out
that
old
serpent
called
the
devil
and
satan
which
deceiveth
the
whole
world
he
was
cast
out
into
the
earth
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
with
him
and
i
heard
a
loud
voice
saying
in
heaven
now
is
come
salvation
and
strength
and
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
the
power
of
his
christ
for
the
accuser
of
our
brethren
is
cast
down
which
accused
them
before
our
god
day
and
night
and
they
overcame
him
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
by
the
word
of
their
testimony
and
they
loved
not
their
lives
unto
the
death
therefore
rejoice
ye
heavens
and
ye
that
dwell
in
them
woe
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time
and
when
the
dragon
saw
that
he
was
cast
unto
the
earth
he
persecuted
the
woman
which
brought
forth
the
man
child
and
to
the
woman
were
given
two
wings
of
a
great
eagle
that
she
might
fly
into
the
wilderness
into
her
place
where
she
is
nourished
for
a
time
and
times
and
half
a
time
from
the
face
of
the
serpent
and
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
flood
after
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
flood
and
the
earth
helped
the
woman
and
the
earth
opened
her
mouth
and
swallowed
up
the
flood
which
the
dragon
cast
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
woman
and
went
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
which
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
and
i
stood
upon
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
saw
a
beast
rise
up
out
of
the
sea
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
upon
his
horns
ten
crowns
and
upon
his
heads
the
name
of
blasphemy
and
the
beast
which
i
saw
was
like
unto
a
leopard
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
bear
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion
and
the
dragon
gave
him
his
power
and
his
seat
and
great
authority
and
i
saw
one
of
his
heads
as
it
were
wounded
to
death
and
his
deadly
wound
was
healed
and
all
the
world
wondered
after
the
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
dragon
which
gave
power
unto
the
beast
and
they
worshipped
the
beast
saying
who
is
like
unto
the
beast
who
is
able
to
make
war
with
him

and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months
and
he
opened
his
mouth
in
blasphemy
against
god
to
blaspheme
his
name
and
his
tabernacle
and
them
that
dwell
in
heaven
and
it
was
given
unto
him
to
make
war
with
the
saints
and
to
overcome
them
and
power
was
given
him
over
all
kindreds
and
tongues
and
nations
and
all
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
shall
worship
him
whose
names
are
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
of
the
lamb
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
if
any
man
have
an
ear
let
him
hear
he
that
leadeth
into
captivity
shall
go
into
captivity
he
that
killeth
with
the
sword
must
be
killed
with
the
sword
here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of
the
saints
and
i
beheld
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
and
he
had
two
horns
like
a
lamb
and
he
spake
as
a
dragon
and
he
exerciseth
all
the
power
of
the
first
beast
before
him
and
causeth
the
earth
and
them
which
dwell
therein
to
worship
the
first
beast
whose
deadly
wound
was
healed
and
he
doeth
great
wonders
so
that
he
maketh
fire
come
down
from
heaven
on
the
earth
in
the
sight
of
men
and
deceiveth
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
the
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
had
power
to
do
in
the
sight
of
the
beast
saying
to
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
that
they
should
make
an
image
to
the
beast
which
had
the
wound
by
a
sword
and
did
live
and
he
had
power
to
give
life
unto
the
image
of
the
beast
that
the
image
of
the
beast
should
both
speak
and
cause
that
as
many
as
would
not
worship
the
image
of
the
beast
should
be
killed
and
he
causeth
all
both
small
and
great
rich
and
poor
free
and
bond
to
receive
a
mark
in
their
right
hand
or
in
their
foreheads
and
that
no
man
might
buy
or
sell
save
he
that
had
the
mark
or
the
name
of
the
beast
or
the
number
of
his
name
here
is
wisdom
let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
and
his
number
is
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
and
i
looked
and
lo
a
lamb
stood
on
the
mount
sion
and
with
him
an
hundred
forty
and
four
thousand
having
his
fathers
name
written
in
their
foreheads
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
a
great
thunder
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
and
they
sung
as
it
were
a
new
song
before
the
throne
and
before
the
four
beasts
and
the
elders
and
no
man
could
learn
that
song
but
the
hundred
and
forty
and
four
thousand
which
were
redeemed
from
the
earth
these
are
they
which
were
not
defiled
with
women
for
they
are
virgins
these
are
they
which
follow
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth
these
were
redeemed
from
among
men
being
the
firstfruits
unto
god
and
to
the
lamb
and
in
their
mouth
was
found
no
guile
for
they
are
without
fault
before
the
throne
of
god
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
and
there
followed
another
angel
saying
babylon
is
fallen
is
fallen
that
great
city
because
she
made
all
nations
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
and
the
third
angel
followed
them
saying
with
a
loud
voice
if
any
man
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
receive
his
mark
in
his
forehead
or
in
his
hand
the
same
shall
drink
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
poured
out
without
mixture
into
the
cup
of
his
indignation
and
he
shall
be
tormented
with
fire
and
brimstone
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
angels
and
in
the
presence
of
the
lamb
and
the
smoke
of
their
torment
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
they
have
no
rest
day
nor
night
who
worship
the
beast
and
his
image
and
whosoever
receiveth
the
mark
of
his
name
here
is
the
patience
of
the
saints
here
are
they
that
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
the
faith
of
jesus
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
unto
me
write
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labours
and
their
works
do
follow
them
and
i
looked
and
behold
a
white
cloud
and
upon
the
cloud
one
sat
like
unto
the
son
of
man
having
on
his
head
a
golden
crown
and
in
his
hand
a
sharp
sickle
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
crying
with
a
loud
voice
to
him
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
thy
sickle
and
reap
for
the
time
is
come
for
thee
to
reap
for
the
harvest
of
the
earth
is
ripe
and
he
that
sat
on
the
cloud
thrust
in
his
sickle
on
the
earth
and
the
earth
was
reaped
and
another
angel
came
out
of
the
temple
which
is
in
heaven
he
also
having
a
sharp
sickle
and
another
angel
came
out
from
the
altar
which
had
power
over
fire
and
cried
with
a
loud
cry
to
him
that
had
the
sharp
sickle
saying
thrust
in
thy
sharp
sickle
and
gather
the
clusters
of
the
vine
of
the
earth
for
her
grapes
are
fully
ripe
and
the
angel
thrust
in
his
sickle
into
the
earth
and
gathered
the
vine
of
the
earth
and
cast
it
into
the
great
winepress
of
the
wrath
of
god
and
the
winepress
was
trodden
without
the
city
and
blood
came
out
of
the
winepress
even
unto
the
horse
bridles
by
the
space
of
a
thousand
and
six
hundred
furlongs
and
i
saw
another
sign
in
heaven
great
and
marvellous
seven
angels
having
the
seven
last
plagues
for
in
them
is
filled
up
the
wrath
of
god
and
i
saw
as
it
were
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
them
that
had
gotten
the
victory
over
the
beast
and
over
his
image
and
over
his
mark
and
over
the
number
of
his
name
stand
on
the
sea
of
glass
having
the
harps
of
god
and
they
sing
the
song
of
moses
the
servant
of
god
and
the
song
of
the
lamb
saying
great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works
lord
god
almighty
just
and
true
are
thy
ways
thou
king
of
saints
who
shall
not
fear
thee
o
lord
and
glorify
thy
name
for
thou
only
art
holy
for
all
nations
shall
come
and
worship
before
thee
for
thy
judgments
are
made
manifest
and
after
that
i
looked
and
behold
the
temple
of
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
heaven
was
opened
and
the
seven
angels
came
out
of
the
temple
having
the
seven
plagues
clothed
in
pure
and
white
linen
and
having
their
breasts
girded
with
golden
girdles
and
one
of
the
four
beasts
gave
unto
the
seven
angels
seven
golden
vials
full
of
the
wrath
of
god
who
liveth
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
temple
was
filled
with
smoke
from
the
glory
of
god
and
from
his
power
and
no
man
was
able
to
enter
into
the
temple
till
the
seven
plagues
of
the
seven
angels
were
fulfilled
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
saying
to
the
seven
angels
go
your
ways
and
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
earth
and
the
first
went
and
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
earth
and
there
fell
a
noisome
and
grievous
sore
upon
the
men
which
had
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
upon
them
which
worshipped
his
image
and
the
second
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sea
and
it
became
as
the
blood
of
a
dead
man
and
every
living
soul
died
in
the
sea
and
the
third
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
rivers
and
fountains
of
waters
and
they
became
blood
and
i
heard
the
angel
of
the
waters
say
thou
art
righteous
o
lord
which
art
and
wast
and
shalt
be
because
thou
hast
judged
thus
for
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
saints
and
prophets
and
thou
hast
given
them
blood
to
drink
for
they
are
worthy
and
i
heard
another
out
of
the
altar
say
even
so
lord
god
almighty
true
and
righteous
are
thy
judgments
and
the
fourth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
sun
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
scorch
men
with
fire
and
men
were
scorched
with
great
heat
and
blasphemed
the
name
of
god
which
hath
power
over
these
plagues
and
they
repented
not
to
give
him
glory
and
the
fifth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
seat
of
the
beast
and
his
kingdom
was
full
of
darkness
and
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
pain
and
blasphemed
the
god
of
heaven
because
of
their
pains
and
their
sores
and
repented
not
of
their
deeds
and
the
sixth
angel
poured
out
his
vial
upon
the
great
river
euphrates
and
the
water
thereof
was
dried
up
that
the
way
of
the
kings
of
the
east
might
be
prepared
and
i
saw
three
unclean
spirits
like
frogs
come
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
dragon
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
beast
and
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
false
prophet
for
they
are
the
spirits
of
devils
working
miracles
which
go
forth
unto
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
of
the
whole
world
to
gather
them
to
the
battle
of
that
great
day
of
god
almighty
behold
i
come
as
a
thief
blessed
is
he
that
watcheth
and
keepeth
his
garments
lest
he
walk
naked
and
they
see
his
shame
and
he
gathered
them
together
into
a
place
called
in
the
hebrew
tongue
armageddon
and
the
seventh
angel
poured
out
his
vial
into
the
air
and
there
came
a
great
voice
out
of
the
temple
of
heaven
from
the
throne
saying
it
is
done
and
there
were
voices
and
thunders
and
lightnings
and
there
was
a
great
earthquake
such
as
was
not
since
men
were
upon
the
earth
so
mighty
an
earthquake
and
so
great
and
the
great
city
was
divided
into
three
parts
and
the
cities
of
the
nations
fell
and
great
babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
god
to
give
unto
her
the
cup
of
the
wine
of
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
and
every
island
fled
away
and
the
mountains
were
not
found
and
there
fell
upon
men
a
great
hail
out
of
heaven
every
stone
about
the
weight
of
a
talent
and
men
blasphemed
god
because
of
the
plague
of
the
hail
for
the
plague
thereof
was
exceeding
great
and
there
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
and
talked
with
me
saying
unto
me
come
hither
i
will
shew
unto
thee
the
judgment
of
the
great
whore
that
sitteth
upon
many
waters
with
whom
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
have
been
made
drunk
with
the
wine
of
her
fornication
so
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
and
i
saw
a
woman
sit
upon
a
scarlet
coloured
beast
full
of
names
of
blasphemy
having
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
the
woman
was
arrayed
in
purple
and
scarlet
colour
and
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
pearls
having
a
golden
cup
in
her
hand
full
of
abominations
and
filthiness
of
her
fornication
and
upon
her
forehead
was
a
name
written
mystery
babylon
the
great
the
mother
of
harlots
and
abominations
of
the
earth
and
i
saw
the
woman
drunken
with
the
blood
of
the
saints
and
with
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
of
jesus
and
when
i
saw
her
i
wondered
with
great
admiration
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
wherefore
didst
thou
marvel
i
will
tell
thee
the
mystery
of
the
woman
and
of
the
beast
that
carrieth
her
which
hath
the
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
the
beast
that
thou
sawest
was
and
is
not
and
shall
ascend
out
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
go
into
perdition
and
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
wonder
whose
names
were
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
when
they
behold
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
and
yet
is
and
here
is
the
mind
which
hath
wisdom
the
seven
heads
are
seven
mountains
on
which
the
woman
sitteth
and
there
are
seven
kings
five
are
fallen
and
one
is
and
the
other
is
not
yet
come
and
when
he
cometh
he
must
continue
a
short
space
and
the
beast
that
was
and
is
not
even
he
is
the
eighth
and
is
of
the
seven
and
goeth
into
perdition
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
are
ten
kings
which
have
received
no
kingdom
as
yet
but
receive
power
as
kings
one
hour
with
the
beast
these
have
one
mind
and
shall
give
their
power
and
strength
unto
the
beast
these
shall
make
war
with
the
lamb
and
the
lamb
shall
overcome
them
for
he
is
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
and
they
that
are
with
him
are
called
and
chosen
and
faithful
and
he
saith
unto
me
the
waters
which
thou
sawest
where
the
whore
sitteth
are
peoples
and
multitudes
and
nations
and
tongues
and
the
ten
horns
which
thou
sawest
upon
the
beast
these
shall
hate
the
whore
and
shall
make
her
desolate
and
naked
and
shall
eat
her
flesh
and
burn
her
with
fire
for
god
hath
put
in
their
hearts
to
fulfil
his
will
and
to
agree
and
give
their
kingdom
unto
the
beast
until
the
words
of
god
shall
be
fulfilled
and
the
woman
which
thou
sawest
is
that
great
city
which
reigneth
over
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
after
these
things
i
saw
another
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
great
power
and
the
earth
was
lightened
with
his
glory
and
he
cried
mightily
with
a
strong
voice
saying
babylon
the
great
is
fallen
is
fallen
and
is
become
the
habitation
of
devils
and
the
hold
of
every
foul
spirit
and
a
cage
of
every
unclean
and
hateful
bird
for
all
nations
have
drunk
of
the
wine
of
the
wrath
of
her
fornication
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
have
committed
fornication
with
her
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
are
waxed
rich
through
the
abundance
of
her
delicacies
and
i
heard
another
voice
from
heaven
saying
come
out
of
her
my
people
that
ye
be
not
partakers
of
her
sins
and
that
ye
receive
not
of
her
plagues
for
her
sins
have
reached
unto
heaven
and
god
hath
remembered
her
iniquities
reward
her
even
as
she
rewarded
you
and
double
unto
her
double
according
to
her
works
in
the
cup
which
she
hath
filled
fill
to
her
double
how
much
she
hath
glorified
herself
and
lived
deliciously
so
much
torment
and
sorrow
give
her
for
she
saith
in
her
heart
i
sit
a
queen
and
am
no
widow
and
shall
see
no
sorrow
therefore
shall
her
plagues
come
in
one
day
death
and
mourning
and
famine
and
she
shall
be
utterly
burned
with
fire
for
strong
is
the
lord
god
who
judgeth
her
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
who
have
committed
fornication
and
lived
deliciously
with
her
shall
bewail
her
and
lament
for
her
when
they
shall
see
the
smoke
of
her
burning
standing
afar
off
for
the
fear
of
her
torment
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
babylon
that
mighty
city
for
in
one
hour
is
thy
judgment
come
and
the
merchants
of
the
earth
shall
weep
and
mourn
over
her
for
no
man
buyeth
their
merchandise
any
more
the
merchandise
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
of
pearls
and

weeping
and

and
saying

great
city
that

clothed
in

and
pearls

for
in
one
hour
so

and
every
shipmaster
and
all
the
company
in
ships
and
sailors
and
as
many
as
trade
by
sea
stood
afar
off
and
cried
when
they
saw
the
smoke
of
her
burning
saying
what
city
is
like
unto
this
great
city

and
they
cast
dust
on
their
heads
and
cried
weeping
and
wailing
saying
alas
alas
that
great
city
wherein
were
made
rich
all
that
had
ships
in
the
sea
by
reason
of
her
costliness
for
in
one
hour
is
she
made
desolate
rejoice
over
her
thou
heaven
and
ye
holy
apostles
and
prophets
for
god
hath
avenged
you
on
her
and
a
mighty
angel
took
up
a
stone
like
a
great
millstone
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
saying
thus
with
violence
shall
that
great
city
babylon
be
thrown
down
and
shall
be
found
no
more
at
all
and
the
voice

more
at

in
thee
and
no

any
more
in
thee
and
the
sound
of
a
millstone
shall

heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
and
the
light
of
a
candle
shall
shine
no
more
at
all
in
thee
and
the
voice
of
the
bridegroom
and
of
the
bride
shall
be
heard
no
more
at
all
in
thee
for
thy
merchants
were
the
great
men
of
the
earth
for
by
thy
sorceries
were
all
nations
deceived
and
in
her
was
found
the
blood
of
prophets
and
of
saints
and
of
all
that
were
slain
upon
the
earth
and
after
these
things
i
heard
a
great
voice
of
much
people
in
heaven
saying
alleluia
salvation
and
glory
and
honour
and
power
unto
the
lord
our
god
for
true
and
righteous
are
his
judgments
for
he
hath
judged
the
great
whore
which
did
corrupt
the
earth
with
her
fornication
and
hath
avenged
the
blood
of
his
servants
at
her
hand
and
again
they
said
alleluia
and
her
smoke
rose
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
four
and
twenty
elders
and
the
four
beasts
fell
down
and
worshipped
god
that
sat
on
the
throne
saying
amen
alleluia
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
throne
saying
praise
our
god
all
ye
his
servants
and
ye
that
fear
him
both
small
and
great
and
i
heard
as
it
were
the
voice
of
a
great
multitude
and
as
the
voice
of
many
waters
and
as
the
voice
of
mighty
thunderings
saying
alleluia
for
the
lord
god
omnipotent
reigneth
let
us
be
glad
and
rejoice
and
give
honour
to
him
for
the
marriage
of
the
lamb
is
come
and
his
wife
hath
made
herself
ready
and
to
her
was
granted
that
she
should
be
arrayed
in
fine
linen
clean
and
white
for
the
fine
linen
is
the
righteousness
of
saints
and
he
saith
unto
me
write
blessed
are
they
which
are
called
unto
the
marriage
supper
of
the
lamb
and
he
saith
unto
me
these
are
the
true
sayings
of
god
and
i
fell
at
his
feet
to
worship
him
and
he
said
unto
me
see
thou
do
it
not
i
am
thy
fellowservant
and
of
thy
brethren
that
have
the
testimony
of
jesus
worship
god
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
i
saw
heaven
opened
and
behold
a
white
horse
and
he
that
sat
upon
him
was
called
faithful
and
true
and
in
righteousness
he
doth
judge
and
make
war
his
eyes
were
as
a
flame
of
fire
and
on
his
head
were
many
crowns
and
he
had
a
name
written
that
no
man
knew
but
he
himself
and
he
was
clothed
with
a
vesture
dipped
in
blood
and
his
name
is
called
the
word
of
god
and
the
armies
which
were
in
heaven
followed
him
upon
white
horses
clothed
in
fine
linen
white
and
clean
and
out
of
his
mouth
goeth
a
sharp
sword
that
with
it
he
should
smite
the
nations
and
he
shall
rule
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
he
treadeth
the
winepress
of
the
fierceness
and
wrath
of
almighty
god
and
he
hath
on
his
vesture
and
on
his
thigh
a
name
written
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
and
i
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
to
all
the
fowls
that
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
come
and
gather
yourselves
together
unto
the
supper
of
the
great
god
that
ye
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
and
the
flesh
of
captains
and
the
flesh
of
mighty
men
and
the
flesh
of
horses
and
of
them
that
sit
on
them
and
the
flesh
of
all
men
both
free
and
bond
both
small
and
great
and
i
saw
the
beast
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
and
their
armies
gathered
together
to
make
war
against
him
that
sat
on
the
horse
and
against
his
army
and
the
beast
was
taken
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
that
wrought
miracles
before
him
with
which
he
deceived
them
that
had
received
the
mark
of
the
beast
and
them
that
worshipped
his
image
these
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone
and
the
remnant
were
slain
with
the
sword
of
him
that
sat
upon
the
horse
which
sword
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
and
all
the
fowls
were
filled
with
their
flesh
and
i
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
and
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon
that
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
and
satan
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years
and
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
and
shut
him
up
and
set
a
seal
upon
him
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled
and
after
that
he
must
be
loosed
a
little
season
and
i
saw
thrones
and
they
sat
upon
them
and
judgment
was
given
unto
them
and
i
saw
the
souls
of
them
that
were
beheaded
for
the
witness
of
jesus
and
for
the
word
of
god
and
which
had
not
worshipped
the
beast
neither
his
image
neither
had
received
his
mark
upon
their
foreheads
or
in
their
hands
and
they
lived
and
reigned
with
christ
a
thousand
years
but
the
rest
of
the
dead
lived
not
again
until
the
thousand
years
were
finished
this
is
the
first
resurrection
blessed
and
holy
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
but
they
shall
be
priests
of
god
and
of
christ
and
shall
reign
with
him
a
thousand
years
and
when
the
thousand
years
are
expired
satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison
and
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
which
are
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
gog
and
magog
to
gather
them
together
to
battle
the
number
of
whom
is
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
they
went
up
on
the
breadth
of
the
earth
and
compassed
the
camp
of
the
saints
about
and
the
beloved
city
and
fire
came
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
and
devoured
them
and
the
devil
that
deceived
them
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
the
beast
and
the
false
prophet
are
and
shall
be
tormented
day
and
night
for
ever
and
ever
and
i
saw
a
great
white
throne
and
him
that
sat
on
it
from
whose
face
the
earth
and
the
heaven
fled
away
and
there
was
found
no
place
for
them
and
i
saw
the
dead
small
and
great
stand
before
god
and
the
books
were
opened
and
another
book
was
opened
which
is
the
book
of
life
and
the
dead
were
judged
out
of
those
things
which
were
written
in
the
books
according
to
their
works
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
delivered
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
their
works
and
death
and
hell
were
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
this
is
the
second
death
and
whosoever
was
not
found
written
in
the
book
of
life
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
and
there
was
no
more
sea
and
i
john
saw
the
holy
city
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
behold
the
tabernacle
of
god
is
with
men
and
he
will
dwell
with
them
and
they
shall
be
his
people
and
god
himself
shall
be
with
them
and
be
their
god
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
and
he
that
sat
upon
the
throne
said
behold
i
make
all
things
new
and
he
said
unto
me
write
for
these
words
are
true
and
faithful
and
he
said
unto
me
it
is
done
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
i
will
give
unto
him
that
is
athirst
of
the
fountain
of
the
water
of
life
freely
he
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
and
i
will
be
his
god
and
he
shall
be
my
son
but
the
fearful
and
unbelieving
and
the
abominable
and
murderers
and
whoremongers
and
sorcerers
and
idolaters
and
all
liars
shall
have
their
part
in
the
lake
which
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
second
death
and
there
came
unto
me
one
of
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
vials
full
of
the
seven
last
plagues
and
talked
with
me
saying
come
hither
i
will
shew
thee
the
bride
the
lambs
wife
and
he
carried
me
away
in
the
spirit
to
a
great
and
high
mountain
and
shewed
me
that
great
city
the
holy
jerusalem
descending
out
of
heaven
from
god
having
the
glory
of
god
and
her
light
was
like
unto
a
stone
most
precious
even
like
a
jasper
stone
clear
as
crystal
and
had
a
wall
great
and
high
and
had
twelve
gates
and
at
the
gates
twelve
angels
and
names
written
thereon
which
are
the
names
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
on
the
east
three
gates
on
the
north
three
gates
on
the
south
three
gates
and
on
the
west
three
gates
and
the
wall
of
the
city
had
twelve
foundations
and
in
them
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
and
he
that
talked
with
me
had
a
golden
reed
to
measure
the
city
and
the
gates
thereof
and
the
wall
thereof
and
the
city
lieth
foursquare
and
the
length
is
as
large
as
the
breadth
and
he
measured
the
city
with
the
reed
twelve
thousand
furlongs
the
length
and
the
breadth
and
the
height
of
it
are
equal
and
he
measured
the
wall
thereof
an
hundred
and
forty
and
four
cubits
according
to
the
measure
of
a
man
that
is
of
the
angel
and
the
building
of
the
wall
of
it
was
of
jasper
and
the
city
was
pure
gold
like
unto
clear
glass
and
the
foundations
of
the
wall
of
the
city
were
garnished
with
all
manner
of
precious
stones
the
first
foundation
was
jasper
the
second
sapphire
the
third
a
chalcedony
the
fourth
an
emerald
the
fifth
sardonyx
the
sixth
sardius
the
seventh
chrysolyte
the
eighth
beryl
the
ninth
a
topaz
the
tenth
a
chrysoprasus
the
eleventh
a
jacinth
the
twelfth
an
amethyst
and
the
twelve
gates
were
twelve
pearls
every
several
gate
was
of
one
pearl
and
the
street
of
the
city
was
pure
gold
as
it
were
transparent
glass
and
i
saw
no
temple
therein
for
the
lord
god
almighty
and
the
lamb
are
the
temple
of
it
and
the
city
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
and
the
nations
of
them
which
are
saved
shall
walk
in
the
light
of
it
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
do
bring
their
glory
and
honour
into
it
and
the
gates
of
it
shall
not
be
shut
at
all
by
day
for
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
shall
bring
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
nations
into
it
and
there
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
it
any
thing
that
defileth
neither
whatsoever
worketh
abomination
or
maketh
a
lie
but
they
which
are
written
in
the
lambs
book
of
life
and
he
shewed
me
a
pure
river
of
water
of
life
clear
as
crystal
proceeding
out
of
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
in
the
midst
of
the
street
of
it
and
on
either
side
of
the
river
was
there
the
tree
of
life
which
bare
twelve
manner
of
fruits
and
yielded
her
fruit
every
month
and
the
leaves
of
the
tree
were
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
and
there
shall
be
no
more
curse
but
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
shall
be
in
it
and
his
servants
shall
serve
him
and
they
shall
see
his
face
and
his
name
shall
be
in
their
foreheads
and
there
shall
be
no
night
there
and
they
need
no
candle
neither
light
of
the
sun
for
the
lord
god
giveth
them
light
and
they
shall
reign
for
ever
and
ever
and
he
said
unto
me
these
sayings
are
faithful
and
true
and
the
lord
god
of
the
holy
prophets
sent
his
angel
to
shew
unto
his
servants
the
things
which
must
shortly
be
done

fell
down
to
worship
before

feet
of

things
